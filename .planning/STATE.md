## Current Status

- **Active milestone**: Milestone 1 — Pipeline Autônomo + Qualidade + Fontes
- **Active phase**: None (ready to start Phase 1)
- **Last completed**: Project initialization + reorganization

## Completed Work

| Date | What |
|------|------|
| 2026-03-22 | Project reorganized: app/, scripts/, docs/, data/, .planning/ |
| 2026-03-22 | PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md created |
| 2026-03-22 | 4 research reports created in .planning/research/ |

## Research Available

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| `.planning/research/lead-sources.md` | APIs BR, Receita Federal dataset, Outscraper, Prospeo |
| `.planning/research/pipeline-automation.md` | APScheduler patterns, Brevo email, healthchecks.io |
| `.planning/research/saas-portal.md` | Credit-per-reveal, SELECT FOR UPDATE, niche request queue |
| `.planning/research/lead-quality.md` | email-validator, phonenumbers, 6-dimension score |

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Brevo email for reports (not WhatsApp now) | Zero setup, key already in AWS SM |
| Credit-per-reveal model | Industry standard (Apollo, Hunter, Lusha) |
| SELECT FOR UPDATE for credits | Prevents race condition on concurrent reveals |
| Receita Federal local import | Zero cost, 60M+ companies, no rate limits |
| APScheduler 3.x (keep, don't upgrade) | 4.x is pre-release/not production-ready |
| pipeline_config table (not hardcoded) | Enables admin UI config without code changes |
| Reveal gate before export in roadmap | You reveal before you bulk-export |

## Next Action

Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create the execution plan for Phase 1 (Pipeline Automático).
